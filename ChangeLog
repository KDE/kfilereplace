- I added a method 'editStrings' that fixes tha behaviour when a user 
  chooses edit string option instead of add string option.
- I modified the property textFormat of the QTextEdit widgets of
  KAddstringDlg, from the value 'AutoText' to the value 'PlainText',
  so the QTextEdit widgets will not try to render a string containing
  html code.
