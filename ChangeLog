- The icons in toolbar directory were redrawn.
- Deleted the KFRHeader struct from  apistruct.h.
- The mechanism of saving the string rules has been modified: now we can save the rules in a file like
  this "a_file_name.kfr" that is an XML file.
- The file containing the results of the operations  is now a XHTML file.
- Two new files UI added: now KOptionDlg inherits from KOptionDlgS and KAddstringDlg inherits from KAddstringDlgS.
- The klistviewstring.(h,cpp) were removed.
- A lot of clean up has been made in all files.
